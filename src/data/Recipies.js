    instructions: "Now start step by step making Biryani. Marinate the Chicken: We start by preparing the chicken. We put the chicken in a steel pan and add the yogurt, garlic paste, ginger paste, and all the spices under the marinate section and put the chicken and mix well so that chicken soaks the taste. Cover and refrigerate the whole mixture for a while so it soaks the mixture. Prepare the fried onions. Add the ghee in the cooking pan and flame it high initially for a while, adding the sliced onion and then slow the flame so that our Chaudhary favorite onion does not fry and burn. So when the onion turns to brown, we add the marinated chicken inside and mix well and fry the chicken on slow flame; after 10 minutes, add some water and make the flame slightly high as before and leave the chicken for cooking for 25 minutes so that it would be tender well. Now we move forward to our next step: Boil the Rice. While chicken is cooking on slow flame, we boiled to save our time and double quantity of water in the pan and add rice to leave it for 20 minutes until it softens on high flame. But slow the flame if water boiled too quickly to prevent it from sticking at the bottom. Layering the Biryani: At last important step, some people add rice coloring color to give extra color; do it if you have less quantity of chicken, so we have enough so we do not do this. Now add boiled Rice and cooked marinated chicken in the same pot and mix gently, not to rush to mix everything; mix half of it. So that it gives two color rice. Lastly, we have to give Dam to whole mixture: Seal the pot tightly with aluminum foil or a clean kitchen towel, then cover with a lid to trap the steam. Cook on low heat for 20–25 minutes. This slow “dum” allows all the layers to absorb each other’s flavors, creating that authentic Karachi-style aroma and taste. Serve the Biryani: Once cooked properly, remove the lid. Now you enjoy your famous Karachi Biryani. Eat it with raita and sprite; it gives dead one to life.",
